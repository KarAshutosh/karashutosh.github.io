## Introduction to Linux Hardening

**Linux hardening** encompasses configuring the OS and its services to minimize vulnerabilities and reduce attack surfaces, preventing breaches and unauthorized access.

---

## Why System Hardening Is Critical

Servers face constant threats, from brute-force attacks and privilege escalation exploits to malware, misconfigurations, and insider threats. Implementing server hardening helps protect against these risks by:

- **Reducing the Attack Surface:** Disabling unnecessary services and features so only essential components are exposed.
- **Preventing Exploitation:** Securing daemons, patching misconfigurations, and keeping software up to date to block common breach points.
- **Blocking Unauthorized Access and Privilege Escalation:** Tightening user permissions and access controls to stop attackers in their tracks.
- **Mitigating Risk:** Minimizing the chances of data breaches, reputational damage, and costly downtime.
- **Ensuring Compliance:** Many regulations, such as PCI DSS and HIPAA, require secure default configurations and proactive hardening.

By systematically hardening servers, organizations build a strong security foundation that protects both their data and their reputation.

---

## Common Attack Vectors on Linux

- **Brute-force attacks & weak credentials:** Automated password-guessing attempts or leaked passwords.
- **Privilege escalation:** Exploiting misconfigured permissions, SUID binaries, or kernel vulnerabilities to gain root access.
- **Malware and rootkits:** Malicious code targeting critical system resources.
- **Vulnerable or misconfigured services:** Outdated packages, exposed network services, or misconfigured daemons such as SSH, web, or database servers.
- **Open and unmonitored network ports:** Increasing the attack surface for remote attackers.
- **Unrestricted processes and exposed data:** Running unnecessary processes or leaving sensitive data accessible.
- **Web and application exploits:** SQL injection and other attacks targeting server-side applications.
- **Local exploits:** Abuses of file or system permissions due to misconfigurations or kernel bugs.

---

## Key Security Principles

- **Least Privilege:** Users and processes have only the permissions required.
- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security across system components.
- **Separation of Duties:** Different roles/tasks for users to avoid privilege abuse.
- **Auditing and Accountability:** Log all critical changes and monitor for anomalies.
- **Security by configuration:** Disable unnecessary features/services.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults:** Systems should deny access unless explicitly allowed.
---

## System Updates & Patch Management

### Steps

1. **Manual Updates:**
  ```sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
  sudo apt full-upgrade -y
  ```
  `sudo apt full-upgrade -y` → Upgrades packages, allowing removal or installation of new dependencies if needed. This ensures that all packages are fully up-to-date and resolves dependency changes that apt upgrade cannot.

2. **Install and Configure Automatic Security Updates:**
  ```sh
  sudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges -y
  ```
  - `sudo apt install unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges -y` → Installs:
    - `unattended-upgrades`: Automatically installs security updates.
    - `apt-listchanges`: Shows a summary of what changed in a package before upgrading. Optional but useful for sysadmins.
  ```sh
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades
  ```

3. Review Configuration file

  Review the file `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades` for configuration.
  
  - This is the main configuration file where you can:
    - Choose which updates are installed automatically.
    - Configure email notifications.
    - Lock updates to only security packages or also include regular package updates.

4. **Verify Package Integrity:**
  - Only packages installed via dpkg/apt:  
    ```sh
    dpkg --verify
    ```
  - Full checksum verification:
    ```sh
    sudo apt install debsums -y
    sudo debsums -s
    ```
  - Always use official repositories and enable GPG key checking.

`dpkg --verify` checks installed packages for file changes (permissions, checksums).

`dpkg --verify` only works on packages installed via `dpkg`/`apt` and requires `debsums` to be installed for full checksum verification

---

## User & Group Management

Absolutely! Let's go **command by command**, explaining what it does, why it's used, and the security reasoning behind it. I'll go section by section from the merged document.


### Listing Users

**Command:**

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```

- **What it does:**

  - `cut` extracts specific fields from a text file.
  - `-d:` sets the delimiter to `:` (colon), which separates fields in `/etc/passwd`.
  - `-f1` selects the first field, which is the username.
- **Why it's used:**

  - To get a list of all user accounts on the system. Useful for auditing accounts and identifying unused or unexpected users.


**Command:**

```bash
awk -F: '($3 == "0") {print}' /etc/passwd
```

- **What it does:**

  - `awk` processes text line by line.
  - `-F:` sets the field separator to `:`.
  - `($3 == "0") {print}` prints lines where the 3rd field (UID) equals 0.
- **Why it's used:**

  - UID 0 means root-level privileges. This command checks if there are any users other than `root` with full administrative access.
  - Helps detect privilege escalation risks.


### Creating Secure User Accounts

**Command:**

```bash
sudo adduser newuser
```

- **What it does:**

  - Creates a new user account interactively, asking for password and optional user details.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Adds users securely while automatically creating home directories and necessary default settings.


**Command:**

```bash
sudo passwd -l root
```

- **What it does:**

  - Locks the password for the `root` account, preventing direct password login.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Forces administrators to use `sudo` instead of logging in as root directly, reducing the risk of full system compromise.


**Security Note:**

- Only `root` should have UID 0. This prevents accidental creation of other accounts with unrestricted access.


### User Management

**Removing or Disabling Unused Accounts**

**Command:**

```bash
sudo awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd
```

- **What it does:**

  - Prints the first field (username) from every line in `/etc/passwd`.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Allows administrators to audit all accounts and identify users that are no longer needed.

**Command:**

```bash
sudo deluser username
```

- **What it does:**

  - Removes a user from the system, optionally deleting their home directory.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Reduces attack surface by removing unused accounts that could be exploited.


**Command:**

```bash
sudo usermod -L username
```

- **What it does:**

  - Locks the specified user account.
  - Prevents password login without deleting the account.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Useful for temporarily disabling accounts without losing user data.

**Enforcing Password Policies**

**File:** `/etc/login.defs`

```
PASS_MAX_DAYS   90
PASS_MIN_DAYS   1
PASS_WARN_AGE   7
PASS_MIN_LEN    12
```

- **What they do:**

  - `PASS_MAX_DAYS`: Maximum number of days a password is valid before expiration.
  - `PASS_MIN_DAYS`: Minimum days before a password can be changed.
  - `PASS_WARN_AGE`: Days before expiry to warn the user.
  - `PASS_MIN_LEN`: Minimum password length.

- **Why it's used:**

  - Ensures passwords are regularly changed and meet a baseline length, which reduces risk from weak or compromised passwords.

**Command:**

```bash
sudo apt install libpam-pwquality -y
```

- **What it does:**

  - Installs the PAM module `libpam-pwquality` for enforcing password complexity rules.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Strengthens passwords by requiring combinations of upper/lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.


**File Edit:** `/etc/pam.d/common-password`

```
password requisite pam_pwquality.so retry=3 minlen=12 dcredit=-1 ucredit=-1 ocredit=-1 lcredit=-1
```

- **What it does:**

  - Configures PAM to enforce password quality:

    - `retry=3`: Allows 3 attempts to enter a valid password.
    - `minlen=12`: Minimum length 12 characters.
    - `dcredit=-1, ucredit=-1, ocredit=-1, lcredit=-1`: Requires at least one digit, uppercase, other (special), and lowercase letter.
- **Why it's used:**
  - Prevents weak passwords and enforces complexity policies for system security.


### Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Command:**

```bash
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
```

- **What it does:**

  - Installs the PAM module for Google Authenticator-based MFA.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Adds a second authentication factor, requiring both a password and a time-based one-time code, improving login security.

**Command:**

```bash
google-authenticator
```

- **What it does:**

  - Runs the setup for MFA for a specific user.
  - Generates QR codes, secret keys, and recovery codes.
- **Why it's used:**
  - Links the user account to a Google Authenticator app or compatible TOTP app.


**Edit File:** enable in `/etc/pam.d/sshd` file:

```
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
```

- **What it does:**

  - Tells SSH to require MFA authentication for logins.
- **Why it's used:**

  - Forces all SSH logins to require the one-time code, reducing risk from password theft.

Here's a **fully merged and comprehensive SSH Hardening section**, combining all your sources without missing any details:


---

## SSH Hardening

SSH hardening reduces the risk of unauthorized access, brute-force attacks, and other remote exploits.

### SSH Configuration File

- The main configuration file is:

```
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

All changes below are applied here. After editing, SSH must be reloaded or restarted to apply changes.



### Change Default SSH Port

- **Purpose:** Reduces exposure to automated attacks targeting the default port `22`.

**Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:**

```
Port 2222
```

**Restart or reload SSH:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd   # or reload: sudo systemctl reload sshd
```



### Disable Root Login & Password Authentication

- **Purpose:** Prevents direct root login and enforces key-based authentication.

**In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:**

```
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
```

- **Restart SSH:**

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```



### Use SSH Keys with Passphrases

- **Purpose:** Key-based authentication is more secure than passwords. Adding a passphrase protects private keys.

**Generate a secure key pair:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100
```

- `-t ed25519`: Uses the Ed25519 algorithm, which is secure and fast.
- `-a 100`: Number of rounds for key derivation function (increases resistance to brute-force if the key is stolen).

**Deploy public key:**

- Copy the public key to the server's user account:

```bash
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

- Ensure proper permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```



### Enable Intrusion Prevention with Fail2Ban

- **Purpose:** Protects against brute-force login attempts by banning IPs after multiple failed attempts.

**Install Fail2Ban:**

```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
```

**Configure Fail2Ban:**

```bash
sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
```

**Example configuration for SSH:**

```
[sshd]
enabled  = true
port     = 2222
filter   = sshd
logpath  = /var/log/auth.log
maxretry = 3
bantime  = 1h
```

**Start and enable service:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
```



### Configure Idle Timeouts

- **Purpose:** Automatically disconnects inactive sessions, reducing exposure from abandoned SSH sessions.

**In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:**

```
ClientAliveInterval 300   # Sends a keepalive message every 5 minutes
ClientAliveCountMax 2     # Disconnect after 2 missed keepalives
```

- Alternative configuration sets `ClientAliveCountMax 0` to disconnect immediately after inactivity.



### Enforce Strong Key Exchange Algorithms and Ciphers

- **Purpose:** Ensures only modern, secure cryptography is used for SSH connections.

**Add to `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:**

```
KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
MACs hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
```



### Summary of Recommended `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` Settings

```
Port 2222
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
PermitEmptyPasswords no
ClientAliveInterval 300
ClientAliveCountMax 2
KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256,curve25519-sha256@libssh.org
Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com
MACs hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com
```

- After making all changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Here's a **fully merged and comprehensive "File System & Permission Security" section**, combining all your sources without missing anything:


---

## File System & Permission Security

Securing the file system ensures that sensitive files, directories, and system resources are protected against unauthorized access or tampering. 

### Setting Secure Permissions

- **Tools:**

  - `chmod` → set file/directory permissions
  - `chown` → set ownership
  - `umask` → set default permissions for new files

**Commands:**

```bash
chmod 700 filename       # Full access for owner only
chmod 600 filename       # Read/write for owner only
chown root:root filename # Set owner and group to root
umask 027                # Default permission mask for new files/directories
```

- **Implementation:** Place `umask 027` in `/etc/profile` or `/etc/login.defs` to enforce system-wide defaults.



### Typical Secure Permission Settings

| File/Directory      | Owner | Permissions |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| /boot, /etc/cron.\* | root  | 700         |
| /etc/crontab        | root  | 600         |
| /etc/passwd         | root  | 644         |
| /etc/shadow         | root  | 640         |
| /var/log            | root  | 700         |

- **Why:** Restrict access to critical system files to prevent unauthorized read/write operations.

- **Check for dangerous permissions**:

```bash
find / -perm /6000
```


### Securing `/tmp`, `/var`, and Other Sensitive Directories

- **Purpose:** Prevent execution of malicious scripts in temporary directories and sensitive mounts.

**Mount options in `/etc/fstab`:**

```
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
tmpfs /var/tmp tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults,noexec,nosuid,nodev 0 0
```

- **Remount sensitive directories:**

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,noexec,nosuid,nodev /home
```

- **Create separate partitions** for `/var`, `/var/tmp`, `/var/log` to isolate data and prevent accidental or malicious filling of the root filesystem.



### Disk Encryption (LUKS)

- **Purpose:** Protects data at rest, especially on laptops, cloud VMs, or systems storing sensitive information.

**Install necessary tool:**

```bash
sudo apt install cryptsetup
```

**Encrypt a disk/partition:**

```bash
sudo cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sdX
```

- **Notes:**

  - During Ubuntu installation, full-disk encryption options are available and recommended.
  - For existing installations, follow advanced guides to migrate data to LUKS-encrypted volumes.


Here's a **fully merged and comprehensive "Firewall & Network Security" section**, combining all your sources without missing anything:

---

## Firewall & Network Security

A properly configured firewall and network security setup reduces exposure to attacks, ensures only necessary services are accessible, and provides logging for monitoring.


### UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)

- **Install UFW:**

```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
```

- **Set default policies:**

```bash
sudo ufw default deny incoming   # Deny all incoming connections by default
sudo ufw default allow outgoing  # Allow all outgoing connections by default
```

- **Allow essential ports/services only** (allowlisting is preferred over blocklisting):

```bash
sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp          # Custom SSH port
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp            # HTTP
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp           # HTTPS
```

- **Enable UFW:**

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose          # Check current rules
```

- **Why:**

  - Reduces attack surface by allowing only required services.
  - Denying everything by default ensures unintentional services aren't exposed.


### Enable Logging

- **Command:**

```bash
sudo ufw logging on
```

- **Log location:** `/var/log/ufw.log`
- **Purpose:**

  - Helps monitor attempted connections and detect suspicious activity.


### Disable Unused Network Services

- **List all services:**

```bash
sudo ss -tulwn                    # Show listening TCP/UDP ports
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
```

- **Stop and disable unnecessary services:**

```bash
sudo systemctl stop service_name
sudo systemctl disable service_name
```

- **Examples of common unnecessary services to disable:**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable avahi-daemon
sudo systemctl disable cups
sudo systemctl disable rpcbind
```

- **Why:**

  - Reduces attack surface by preventing unneeded daemons from running.


### Advanced: Using iptables

- **Purpose:** Provides more granular control than UFW.

**Examples:**

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s <IP_ADDRESS> -j DROP             # Block a specific IP
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT        # Allow HTTP
```

- **Save rules persistently:**

```bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

- **Why:**

  - Useful for fine-tuned rules, rate-limiting, and temporary blocks beyond UFW's scope.


Here's a **fully merged and comprehensive "Service & Process Hardening" section**, combining all your sources without missing anything:

---

## Service & Process Hardening

Hardening services and processes reduces the attack surface by disabling unnecessary services, restricting permissions, and enforcing mandatory access controls.


### Disabling Unnecessary Services

- **Purpose:** Unused services can be exploited by attackers. Removing or disabling them minimizes risk.

**Remove unnecessary packages:**

```bash
sudo apt remove telnet rsh-client rsh-redone-client -y
```

**List enabled services:**

```bash
sudo systemctl list-unit-files --type=service --state=enabled
```

**Disable unneeded services:**

```bash
sudo systemctl disable service_name
sudo systemctl stop service_name
```

- **Why:** Prevents unneeded daemons from running, reducing memory usage and attack surface.


### Restricting Service Permissions

- **Purpose:** Limit the capabilities of running services so that even if compromised, damage is minimized.

**Edit a service unit file:**

```bash
sudo systemctl edit service_name
```

**Add security directives under `[Service]`:**

```
User=nobody
Group=nogroup
ProtectSystem=full      # Makes the filesystem read-only for the service except /etc, /var, /tmp
ProtectHome=yes         # Restricts access to user home directories
NoNewPrivileges=true    # Prevents the service from gaining new privileges
```

- **Why:** Enforces the principle of least privilege for services.


### AppArmor / SELinux

- **Purpose:** Enforce mandatory access controls on applications to restrict what they can do on the system.

**Check AppArmor status:**

```bash
sudo aa-status
```

**Enforce profiles for applications:**

```bash
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/*
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.yourapp
```

- **Notes:**
  - Ubuntu defaults to **AppArmor**, which is practical and easier to manage.
  - SELinux is more powerful but requires additional setup and is less common on Ubuntu.

---

## Audit & Monitoring

### Install and Enable Auditd

Auditd is the Linux Audit Daemon, used for monitoring system events and changes to critical files.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install auditd audispd-plugins -y
sudo systemctl enable auditd --now
sudo systemctl start auditd
```

**Example audit rules:**

```bash
# Monitor changes to user accounts
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k user-modify
sudo auditctl -w /etc/shadow -p wa -k auth-modify

# Monitor generic system changes (example)
sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p wa -k passwd_changes
```

> **Explanation:**
> `-w <file>` → watch this file
> `-p wa` → watch for write (w) and attribute (a) changes
> `-k <key>` → attach a custom identifier to the event for easy searching


### Log Management

Proper log management ensures that audit events and system activity are recorded and reviewable.

**Using rsyslog:**

```bash
sudo apt install rsyslog -y
sudo systemctl enable rsyslog --now
```

- Configuration file: `/etc/rsyslog.conf`
- Aggregates system logs and audit events.

**Using journalctl:**

```bash
journalctl --verify
journalctl -xe
```

- `--verify` checks for log integrity.
- `-xe` shows recent logs with priority and explains errors.


### Intrusion Detection & File Integrity Monitoring**

**AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)**

```bash
sudo apt install aide -y
sudo aideinit
sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db
sudo aide --check
```

- Automate periodic integrity checks with cron jobs, e.g., daily or weekly.
- Detects unauthorized changes to system files and configuration.

**OSSEC (Open Source HIDS)**

- Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS).
- Steps: install via package or from source, then configure rules and integrate with central logging for multi-server environments.
- Provides alerts for suspicious activity and central management of multiple hosts.


### Notes and Best Practices

- Regularly update audit rules for critical system files (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/sudoers`, etc.).
- Ensure logs are centralized, backed up, and rotated to prevent disk space exhaustion.
- Combine AIDE with auditd logs for comprehensive monitoring.
- Consider integrating OSSEC with SIEM solutions for enterprise environments.

## Kernel & System Parameter Hardening

Kernel and system parameter hardening helps secure the OS against network attacks, information leaks, and unauthorized access.


### Network Security Parameters (`/etc/sysctl.conf`) 

For permanent configuration, edit `/etc/sysctl.conf`.

| Parameter                                   | Recommended Value      | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| net.ipv4.ip\_forward                        | 0                      | Disable IPv4 forwarding                                |
| net.ipv4.conf.all.rp\_filter                | 1                      | Enable source IP address validation (anti-IP spoofing) |
| net.ipv4.conf.default.rp\_filter            | 1                      | Same as above                                          |
| net.ipv4.tcp\_syncookies                    | 1                      | Enable SYN flood protection                            |
| net.ipv4.conf.all.accept\_source\_route     | 0                      | Disable source-routed packets                          |
| net.ipv4.conf.default.accept\_source\_route | 0                      | Same as above                                          |
| net.ipv4.icmp\_echo\_ignore\_broadcasts     | 1                      | Ignore ICMP broadcast requests                         |
| net.ipv4.conf.all.send\_redirects           | 0                      | Disable sending ICMP redirects                         |
| net.ipv6.conf.all.disable\_ipv6             | 1 (if IPv6 not needed) | Disable IPv6                                           |
| net.ipv6.conf.default.disable\_ipv6         | 1 (if IPv6 not needed) | Disable IPv6                                           |
| kernel.randomize\_va\_space                 | 2                      | Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)       |
| fs.suid\_dumpable                           | 0                      | Disable core dumps for SUID binaries                   |

Disabling prevents attackers from finding sensitive info in dumps.

**Apply the changes immediately:**

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

> **Explanation of important parameters:**
>
> - `net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0` → Prevents IP forwarding to reduce risk of acting as a router.
> - `rp_filter = 1` → Reject packets with spoofed source addresses.
> - `tcp_syncookies = 1` → Mitigates SYN flood DoS attacks.
> - `accept_source_route = 0` → Prevent attackers from specifying packet routes.
> - `icmp_echo_ignore_broadcasts = 1` → Protects against Smurf attacks.
> - `disable_ipv6 = 1` → Turn off IPv6 if not required.
> - `kernel.randomize_va_space = 2` → Randomizes memory layout to hinder exploits.
> - `fs.suid_dumpable = 0` → Prevents sensitive information leaks via core dumps.


### Restrict Core Dumps (`/etc/security/limits.conf`) 

To prevent sensitive information leakage through core dumps:

```
- hard core 0
- soft core 0
```

- This disables core dumps globally for all users.
- `fs.suid_dumpable = 0` further ensures SUID binaries cannot produce core dumps.


### Notes and Best Practices 

- Always backup `/etc/sysctl.conf` before making changes:

```bash
sudo cp /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.conf.bak
```

- After editing `/etc/sysctl.conf`, apply changes:

```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

- Regularly review kernel and sysctl settings to ensure alignment with security policies.
- Use combination of `sysctl`, `limits.conf`, and system hardening guides for comprehensive security.

---

## Application Security

Application security involves hardening applications, containers, and services to minimize the attack surface and enforce least privilege.


### Least Privilege & Sandboxing 

- Run all applications under dedicated low-privilege users.
  Example for a web application:

```bash
sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin mywebapp
```

- Use **AppArmor** or **SELinux** profiles to confine major apps such as web servers, databases, and custom applications.
- Avoid running services as root wherever possible.


### Container Security (Docker / Podman) 

- Use rootless containers whenever possible.
- Regularly update container images and scan them for vulnerabilities.
- Limit container capabilities and use security profiles (e.g., AppArmor).
- Example Docker installation and user setup:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo usermod -aG docker youruser
```

- Run Docker Bench Security to check for common misconfigurations:

```bash
docker run -it --net host --pid host --userns host --cap-add audit_control \
-v /etc:/etc -v /usr/bin/docker-containerd:/usr/bin/docker-containerd \
--label docker_bench_security \
docker/docker-bench-security
```


### Web Application Hardening 

**Apache**

- Disable directory listing.
- Remove test/example files.
- Configure SSL/TLS properly (`ssl.conf`).
- Restrict server tokens.
- Configuration file: `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`

**Nginx**

- Disable server tokens:

```nginx
server_tokens off;
```

- Use strong TLS protocols:

```nginx
ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
```

- Configuration file: `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

**PHP**

- Disable risky functions in `php.ini`:

```ini
disable_functions = exec,passthru,shell_exec,system
```

- Limit accessible directories:

```ini
open_basedir = /var/www/html:/tmp
```

- Set `expose_php = Off`
- Limit file uploads and execution permissions.

**MySQL / MariaDB**

- Bind database service to localhost unless remote access is required:

```ini
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
```

- Use strong user passwords.
- Disallow remote root login.
- Remove anonymous users.


### Best Practices 

- Always run applications and services with **minimal privileges**.
- Maintain **updated containers and images** to avoid vulnerabilities.
- Regularly scan for misconfigurations in containers and web apps.
- Combine **AppArmor/SELinux** with application hardening for layered security.
- Maintain proper TLS configurations for web servers and enforce secure coding practices in applications.

## Backup & Recovery

Reliable backups are essential for recovering from system failures, ransomware, or accidental data loss. Backups should be **automated, encrypted, and regularly tested**.


### Backup Strategies

- Automate regular backups using tools like:

  - **rsync**: Lightweight file synchronization.
  - **rsnapshot**: Incremental backup system.
  - **Borg**: Deduplicating and encrypted backups.
  - **Restic**: Encrypted and deduplicated backups.

- Store backups **offsite** or **offline** to protect against local disasters and ransomware.

- Maintain **backup logs** securely for auditing and verification.


### Backup Encryption 

- Use built-in encryption options of backup tools (Borg, Restic).
- Or use **GPG** for manual encryption:

```bash
gpg -c backup.tar.gz
```

- Ensure the encryption key or passphrase is stored securely and separately from the backup.


### Testing Recovery Procedures 

- Regularly **test restores** to ensure backup integrity.
- Verify both **partial file recovery** and **full system restoration**.
- Document recovery steps and review periodically to ensure they work under emergency conditions.


### Example: Restic Encrypted Backup 

```bash
sudo apt install restic
restic init --repo /path/to/backup
restic backup /path/to/data
```

- Test recovery regularly:

```bash
restic restore latest --target /restore/path
```


### Best Practices 

- Automate backups with cron or systemd timers.
- Keep multiple backup versions for redundancy.
- Encrypt backups to protect sensitive data.
- Store backup logs securely and monitor for failures.
- Periodically verify that both encryption and restore procedures work correctly.

## Compliance & Best Practices


Ensuring compliance with recognized security benchmarks and continuously assessing your system is essential for maintaining a secure Ubuntu 22.04 environment.


### CIS Benchmarks 

- Download and review the [CIS Ubuntu 22.04 Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/ubuntu_linux/).
- Perform checks using tools or manually:

**Lynis Audit:**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install lynis -y
sudo lynis audit system
```

- Review the output for actionable recommendations and follow CIS guidelines.

**OpenSCAP Audit:**

```bash
sudo apt install openscap-scanner -y
# Evaluate using OVAL definitions
sudo oscap oval eval --results results.xml --report report.html oval:com.ubuntu.jammy
# Or XCCDF profiles
sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile <profile_id> --report report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-ubuntu2204-ds.xml
```

- Use **Ubuntu Security Guide (USG)** for additional CIS alignment if desired.


### Security Scanning Tools 

- **Lynis:** Performs comprehensive system audits and provides remediation suggestions.
- **OpenSCAP:** Scans using standardized security content for compliance (CIS, NIST, or custom profiles).
- Schedule regular scans to maintain compliance and detect drift from best practices.


### Continuous Security Assessment

- Integrate regular security scanning into **CI/CD pipelines** for applications and system configurations.
- Schedule recurring audits using Lynis or OpenSCAP.
- Perform internal penetration testing periodically.
- Keep up to date with security advisories:

  - Ubuntu security mailing lists
  - Official CIS and OpenSCAP content updates
  - Vulnerability feeds and patch notices


### Best Practices

- Review CIS benchmark results and implement recommended changes.
- Maintain detailed reports of scans and audits for tracking compliance.
- Automate compliance checks where possible using scripts or security management tools.
- Ensure continuous monitoring to detect misconfigurations or deviations from security policies.
